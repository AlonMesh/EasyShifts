# EasyShifts

## Introduction

EasyShifts is a comprehensive web application designed to streamline the scheduling and shift management process for workplaces operating on a shift-based system. This platform empowers managers to effortlessly handle schedules, assign shifts, and manage employee requests, all within a centralized and user-friendly interface. Employees, on the other hand, can conveniently view their upcoming shifts, submit shift requests, and stay informed about their schedules.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login system for managers and employees.
- **Shift Scheduling**: Managers can create, modify, and assign shifts to employees based on availability and requirements.
- **Shift Requests**: Employees can submit requests for specific shifts or indicate their unavailability.
- **Shift Board**: A visual representation of the shift schedule, allowing managers to easily view and adjust assignments.
- **Employee Management**: Managers can approve or reject new employee registrations for their workplaces.
- **Shift Viewing**: Employees can view their assigned shifts for upcoming dates.

## Project Structure

The frontend of EasyShifts is built using React, while the backend is implemented in Python. The backend server listens for incoming requests from the frontend and interacts with a MySQL database.

### Database

The database consists of six tables, each serving a specific purpose:

1. **Users**: Stores user information, including roles (manager or employee).
2. **Workplaces**: Maintains information about workplaces and their associated users.
3. **UserRequests**: Keeps track of shift requests submitted by employees.
4. **Shifts**: Stores shift details, such as start and end times, dates, and associated workplaces.
5. **ShiftWorkers**: Links users to assigned shifts, enabling tracking of shift assignments.
6. **ShiftBoard**: Handles the shift board data, allowing managers to view and manage shifts based on dates and workplaces.

The database follows a model-repository-service-controller pattern.
